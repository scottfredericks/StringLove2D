# StringLove2D
Wave equation simulation on a string in 2D. Has a few utility functions: Pressing a number key will load a pre-defined configuration for the string. The mouse wheel changes the elasticity of the string. Random perturbations can be added with the R key. The endpoints of the string can be moved using the left and right mouse buttons. This allows you to create waves that travel up and down the string. Made using Lua and the Love2D game engine.

Runs on Windows only. Unfortunately, I no longer have the source code for this project.
