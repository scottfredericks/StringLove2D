This program simulates an elastic string using an array of points. There are two types of strings: open and closed. Open strings have their endpoints either tied down or defined by a function, while closed strings are tied to themselves. You can switch between the two types by pressing the middle mouse button.

The number keys 1-9 are linked to different patterns (modes). 1-8 are pre-programmed, while 9 just makes the string stand still for you to adjust. I suggest playing with the mouse in each of these modes and seeing what effects you can create. Dragging the left mouse button moves one end node, while the right mouse button moves the other.

You can adjust the elasticity with the mousewheel. This will basically speed up or slow down the simulation. Some patterns work better at lower elasticity, while others do not; play around with this setting. Also note that at very high elasticity the string will occasionally glitch out and expand indefinitely.

Pressing r will create random motion within the string, basically causing "white noise". Finally, holding down the spacebar will retain each point's position, but will clear its velocity. This causes the shape to collapse in on itself, and usually results in an oval when used repeatedly.

Most patterns will oscillate back and forth. This means if you draw something in mode 9, it will flip upside down, then back again, repeatedly. There are many other amusing and mesmerizing patterns to be found in this program. Keep trying new things, and let me know if you find something amazing!

Please enjoy this program! I hope it helps give a more intuitive understanding of the wave equation and how elasticity works.
